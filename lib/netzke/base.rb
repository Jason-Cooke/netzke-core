module Netzke
  # The base class for every Netzke component. Its main responsibilities include:
  # * JavaScript class generation and inheritance (using Ext JS class system) which reflects the Ruby class inheritance (see {Netzke::Core::Javascript})
  # * Nesting and dynamic loading of child components (see {Netzke::Core::Composition})
  # * Ruby-side action declaration (see {Netzke::Actions})
  # * I18n
  # * Client-server communication (see {Netzke::Core::Services})
  # * Session-based persistence (see {Netzke::Core::State})
  #
  # == Referring to JavaScript configuration methods from Ruby
  #
  # Netzke allows use Ruby symbols for referring to pre-defined pieces of configuration. Let's say for example, that a toolbar needs to nest a control more complex than a button (say, a date field), and a component should still make it possible to make it's presence and position in the toolbar configurable. We can implement it like this:
  #
  #     action :do_something
  #
  #     def configure(c)
  #       super
  #       c.tbar = [:do_something, :date_selector]
  #     end
  #
  # While :do_something here is referring to a usual Netzke action, :date_selector is not declared in actions. If our JavaScript mixin file contains a method called `dateSelectorConfig`, it will be executed at the moment of configuring `tbar` at client side, and it's result, a config object, will substitute `date_selector`:
  #
  #     {
  #       dateSelectorConfig: function(config){
  #         return {
  #           xtype: 'datefield'
  #         }
  #       }
  #     }
  #
  # This doesn't necessarily have to be used in toolbars, but also in other places in config (i.e. layouts).
